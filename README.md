## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

My project is called Pop, which is short for Plenty of Pets. It is going to be a POF or Tinder like program that lets rescue organizations add
profiles of pets with "dating like" questions that have been revamped to correspond with animals. It will have adopters as users who will browse
the selection of animals from the rescues with the ability to favorite and contact the rescue. The goal of my program is to create better
matches for pet adoptions for the purpose of less returns and more likely to match what the adopter is looking for based on the actual personality
of the animals instead of just looks. It will also help the animals get adopted into homes that better fit any special needs they may have.
